# SCRIPT 1: GENERATE GROUND-TRUTH CHECKSUMS
# We used this to create our "ground-truth" file for RPO verification.

# SCRIPT 2: PROVING DATA CORRUPTION (THE "FILE LOCK" SAGA)
# This sequence demonstrates the real-world file permission issues encountered.
# ---

# Step 1: Attempt to corrupt file as a normal user (failed)
Set-Content -Path "C:\Users\tkira\Documents\project sysadmin NAGGINDA\Photos\Blue and Yellow Modern Upcoming Events Instagram Post (Flyer) (5).png" -Value "This file is now corrupted."
# Result: Access is denied.

# Step 2: Attempt to remove "Read-only" flag as Administrator (also failed)
# (This proved the file was locked by a higher-priority process like OneDrive)
Set-ItemProperty -Path "C:\Users\tkira\Documents\project sysadmin NAGGINDA\Photos\Blue and Yellow Modern Upcoming Events Instagram Post (Flyer) (5).png" -Name IsReadOnly -Value $false
# Result: Access is denied.

# Step 3: Successful corruption after running as Administrator and targeting a non-locked file
# (This hash was used to prove the file was different from the original)
Get-FileHash -Path "C:\Users\tkira\Documents\project sysadmin NAGGINDA\Photos\Blue and Yellow Modern Upcoming Events Instagram Post (Flyer) (5).png" -Algorithm SHA256
# Result: E6617FF242EC7E883E1AB2C5C9A76FCA26DF36BB432C5720D1E988DB719B94EB

# SCRIPT 3: VERIFYING A RESTORE
# We ran this *after* a restore operation to check the file's hash.
# ---
Get-FileHash -Path "C:\Users\tkira\Documents\project sysadmin NAGGINDA\Photos\Blue and Yellow Modern Upcoming Events Instagram Post (Flyer) (5).png" -Algorithm SHA256
# Result (Deletion Test): FE4D89... (SUCCESS)
# Result (Corruption Test): E6617F... (FAILURE - File was not restored)
